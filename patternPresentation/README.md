# Pattern Presentation

This is the [repository](https://github.com/mfrankmore/oop-mfrankmore/tree/master/patternPresentation) for the State pattern assignment, due 4/14/2020.  
  
  The example used is an 'alarm clock' of sorts which informs the user at what times they should be waking up and going to sleep based on the day of the week.  The application is hard coded to run from Sunday - Sunday.
